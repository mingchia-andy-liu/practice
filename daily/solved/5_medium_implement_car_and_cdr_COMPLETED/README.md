Asked by Jane Street.

## Question

`cons(a, b)` constructs a pair, and `car(pair)` and `cdr(pair)` returns the first and last element of that pair. For example, `car(cons(3, 4))` returns `3`, and `cdr(cons(3, 4))` returns `4`.

Given this implementation of `cons`:

```python
def cons(a, b):
    def pair(f):
        return f(a, b)
    return pair
```

Implement `car` and `cdr`.

### Notes

### Questions to ask

1. what's the `f` function? are we implementing `f`?

### Workflow

* pair returns a function which will be called on the closure `a` and `b` variable.
* `f` is the **lambda** that operate on parameter `a` and `b`.

### Time

~ 15 mins

## Thoughts

* functional programming question.
* `f` is the function that `make a choice` which accepts 2 parameters `a` and `b`.
* for the interview question, we will make the `choice` of `first` or `last`

&nbsp;

* There is probably a follow question on this about function programming.
* Interesting question.
* I think the point is to see if they know FP and that python support lambda function üëç

### Anonymous function(lambda)

In general, **anonymous function** is a function that is defined without a name.

In Python, normal functions are defined using the **`def`** keyword; anonymous functions are defined using the **`lambda`** keyword.

**Python lambda syntax**
```python
lambda arguments: expression
```

**Example**
```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 11, 12]

even = filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, my_list)
# even: [2, 4, 6, 8, 12]

double = map(lambda x: x * 2, my_list)
# double: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 22, 24]
```
